    //so there is this guy named dhaval who is kind of wanna become a stoic and wanna follow stoicism for his life to be more and more hard even though it can be easy and simple, he wants to learn the true meaning of delayed gratification and he wants to focus on one thing such that his brain completely only thinks about that one thing and not a minute detail of any other thing goes on e.g when i would perform a tricep pushdown or incline bicep i want to think only about that bicep contraction and relaxation , not even the lyrics or beats of music should be in my mind even when earphones on.This is the focus i want to achieve.

   // Once i learned something from one of my favorite influencer , he wrote that "i would start and end my workout with no music, no dopamine rush,no looking into mirror while workout is going on. This is how i will respect gym"
   
   //and next thing he wrote that i admired was , 
   //even though you know your daily life can be easy that is you can just drop that work right there, you can just drop that gym session right there, you can just not do that work and that won't even affect your life but still if you choose the hard path....then my friend welcome to the path of stoicism
